# Tanzania Water Pump Classification

## Description:

A large portion of Tanzania's population lack access to potable water, so it is imperative to know the functional status of pre-existing water pumps. Using data provided by [Taarifa](http://taarifa.org/) and [Tanzania Ministry of Water](http://maji.go.tz/), we will predict whether a pump is `'functional'`, `'functional needing repair'`, or `'non-functional'` using a variety of machine learning models.

## Necessary Packages:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- seaborn

This predictive modeling challenge comes from [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/), an organization that helps non-profits organizations by hosting data science competitions for social impact. The competition has open licensing: "The data is available for use outside of DrivenData." This project was also part of BloomTech's Data Science curriculum.
